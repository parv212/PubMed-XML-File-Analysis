# PubMed-XML-File-Analysis

This project aimed to extract data from the PubMed XML file. After extraction, the data was stored in a normalized relational schema. Data cleaning was performed on the data. The database was created using MySQL. Next, an AWS Relational Database was created for Data Warehousing and a Star/Snowflake schema was also created. The Data Warehouse created could be used for analysis.
